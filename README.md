# openwrt-config

My config files for the OpenWRT ROuter (at present being used as Wireless Access Points).  Includes 99_uci_defaults script which is an almost generic script that will config two routers as Access Points (called bedroom and living) and along with the secrets file will include passwords and passphrases and along with the mac_hostnames file will stop OpenWRT only outputting unrecognisable MAC addresses, and provde nice names for the devices.
- Made for Xiaomi Mi Router 3 Pro, but can be adpted for most routers.
- After install of firmware remember to log in to router on a browser and go to Network->Wireless to let Luci do it's thing with wireless naming

The files should be organised in this hierachy:
